# 340W-Final

## Implementation platform:
This project is created by Google Colab, and I recommand you to upload the "ipynb" file to Colab to excute the code.

## Data Set Introduction:
1. `Training_test` dataset is extracted from Training and validating images (12+ and 12-). This has not been used in any of the Pr, Re, F1 etc. evaluation. Purly for testing while generating the code. And this is the place where I found the "evil picture". #19 is that picture, and #26 was downloaded from websites and processed to 227 x 227 through Photoshop.
2. `Test_crack` dataset is the True Crack unseen dataset used for testing.
3. `Test_nocrack` dataset is the True Non-Crack unseen dataset used for testing.
4. `Concrete Crack Images for Classification` is the training and validation data set contains 40,000 images total.

## Implementing Instrunctions:
Please leave all dataset in `/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks`.
Please leave `Concrete Crack Images for Classification` **UN**-extracted because the code will do the process for you.
Please all other dataset extracted and place in the above folder. `training_test` will not be used in the actual imlementation. 


## Greeting
**Please let me know if you get any concern and trouble running this. Thank you!**
